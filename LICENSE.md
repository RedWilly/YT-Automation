# Open Contribution License (OCL) v1.0

## Preamble

**The Philosophy Behind This License:**

The Open Contribution License (OCL) is designed to foster a healthy, sustainable open-source ecosystem. We believe software should be freely available for personal use, education, and experimentation. At the same time, we believe that commercial entities that derive value from open-source software should contribute back to the community that created it.

This license is NOT traditional proprietary software licensing. This IS open source with a fair-use requirement: if you're making money with this software, help make it better for everyone.

**In Plain English:**
- **Personal/Non-Commercial Use**: Use it freely, modify it, share it, learn from it—no strings attached.
- **Commercial Use**: If you're using this to make money, contribute something back to the project. It's that simple.
